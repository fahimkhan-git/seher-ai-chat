CHAT BOAT - GEMINI AI IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
============================================

✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - Full Gemini AI Capabilities

The chat API is fully implemented to use Google's Gemini AI exactly like you described:

1. ✅ Uses gemini-1.5-flash via @google/generative-ai
2. ✅ Sends full property context (name, location, pricing, BHK, amenities, offers)
3. ✅ Instructs AI to understand intent, not just keywords
4. ✅ AI searches through provided information
5. ✅ Connects related details naturally
6. ✅ Generates contextual, conversational replies dynamically

CURRENT STATUS:
- Mode: FALLBACK (keyword matching) - GEMINI_API_KEY not set
- Health endpoint: http://localhost:4000/health shows "fallback-keyword-matching"
- Chat responses include: "aiUsed": false, "fallback": true

TO ENABLE FULL GEMINI AI:
1. Get free API key from: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
2. Set GEMINI_API_KEY in apps/api/.env
3. Restart API server
4. Verify: /health shows "full-ai" mode
5. Test: Chat responses will have "aiUsed": true, "model": "gemini-1.5-flash"
